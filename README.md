NFT Makers

This dapp allows you to mint, sell and buy NFTs, so it's basically a marketplace.


What I used to develop it:
- nodejs
- npm
- hardhat
- metamask
- react
- ipfs http client
- openzeppelin
- chaijs (testing utilites)

I've modified the structure of the dapp into the src folder, for me it's more clear to have it like this.




The app is deployed to the Rinkeby testnet.

We can add rinkeby to metamask using this config:
